# About Me Portfolio Page
Week two homework assignment where we were asked to create a web application with a responsive design using Bootstrap CSS framework. We were given a basic design to follow that had three pages: index, portfolio, and contact. I utilized Bootstrap's grid system to minimize the use of media queries and took complete advantage of the Google Chrome developer tools to ensure that they were transferring correctly to the different viewports.
